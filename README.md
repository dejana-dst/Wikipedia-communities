# Wikipedia communities

Wikipedia is a trove of knowledge, where various articles are created and edited multiple times by multiple people. Thus an article represents a cumulative effort of several co-authors. As we define the notion of co-authorship, we can also define a network representing this. In addition, the networks can be created for each respective year, resulting in a series of networks.

It is the goal of this project to look for communities of co-authors, to plot the size distribution of the groups and see how they change over time.
